Simulator for Quadcopter in Python

This code is mainly based on:
https://github.com/gibiansky/experiments/blob/master/quadcopter/matlab/simulate.m

A very good an detailed explanation of the code:

In contrast to the link above a right handed coordinate system is used.

needs numpy
  <br />

  For 3d viualization of the quadcopter set enable3d = True in ProcessPlotter.py. It will slow down the visualization!
